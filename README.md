# Firebase Data Persistence Issue

This repository demonstrates an unusual bug encountered in a Firebase Realtime Database application. The issue involves intermittent data loss where data is written to the database successfully (confirmed by Firebase console), but the data does not consistently reflect in the application's UI or subsequent queries.  No exceptions or errors are thrown during the writing process.

The `bug.js` file contains the original code exhibiting the problem.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a possible solution and explanation.

This bug highlights the importance of handling potential inconsistencies with Firebase data persistence, even when no obvious errors occur.
